# Laboration 1 - Using convolutional network for classification of the Fashion MNIST data set.

Since I'm not an experienced programmer and Python is new to me, I took the oppurtunity to practice and made a GUI for developing convolutional networks. It is implemented in Tkinter. Since developing a flexible GUI, capable of every possible variation of data processing, network architectures and trainging schemes, is a large task, naturally this GUI will have it's limitations.

In the GUI there are different tabs for each step in processing, building, training and evaluating networks:

  1. Loading data and creating augmented data (for the MNIST data set there is also the possiblity of genereating synthetic data).
  2. Visualizing the data
  3. Building a network
  4. Training the network, with the option of performing transfer learning.
  5. Evaluation of the network by confusion matrix and testing prediction capability of manually drawn figures.
  6. Visualization of the activations.
